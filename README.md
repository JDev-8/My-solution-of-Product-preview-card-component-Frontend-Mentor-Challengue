# My solution of Product preview card component Frontend Mentor

This has been my first project in the second stage of the frontend mentor learning path, which focuses on the development of fully responsive web applications, which is essential in modern web design.

Thus, this project meant the use for the first time in a real application of the picture tag in addition to the srcset attribute, which I really liked, since it is always important to become familiar and get used to using as many tags as possible. I also really liked the result obtained, as well as the adaptability for different screens that I achieved in my solution, so I could say that I am on the right footing, in my first steps in responsive development using the mobile firsts technique.
